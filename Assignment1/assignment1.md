# Why it is still worth investing in .Net as a developer?

For me, it is yes, It is still worthy to invest using .net framework. Here are some topics/factors why it is still worth using. 

First for its <strong><em>Support</em></strong>, Microsoft still supporting .net (c# / .net framework). It also has many online communities where you can ask for help / or find a solution to your problem. It is easy to learn because it has many online tutorials / guide (ex. MSDN). Second Becuase of <strong><em>Microsoft (windows Platform)</em></strong>, most of computers today runs windows OS. For some small businesses. it can build some windows app that can help there busineses. Third is for the <strong><em>knowledge</em></strong>. if you have .net knowledge soon it will benefit you understand .net core. For example, you have a project that is an windows application and planning to convert it to cross platform. It is easier for you to convert if you have the base knowledge for .net. Lastly, as a developer with a .net knowledge it has many <strong><em>job/projects oppurtunites</em></strong> I think because most of the companies still using Microsoft Products for their team and projects (365, devOps and azure).
